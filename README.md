# CS112

Homework for the Computability Theory Laboratory (CS Unibuc)

# Explanations

## header.py

Header.py contains functions that can extract useful information from the input files (found in the inputs directory) so it can be used in the emulators.

## FAChecker.py

FAChecker.py contains functions to check that the input files are valid for my emulators. Templates will be added later on.

## Emulators & Generators

I have included a [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) emulator, a [PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton) emulator and a [CFG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) Generator.

# What I want to add later on

- [ ] Template inputs for the emulators

- [ ] An NFA -> DFA translater so my DFA Emulator can read NFA files

- [ ] OR make an NFA emulator
